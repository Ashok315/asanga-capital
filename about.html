The regulatory body uses principle-based primary legislation modeled closely on that used in London and New York. 
              </p>      
               <p>               <strong>Unique Legal Framework- </strong>  DIFC is unique in that it has a legislative system consistent with English Common law. Given its construct, DIFC has its own set of civil and commercial laws and regulations and has developed a complete code of law governing financial services regulation. As part of its autonomy, DIFC has created an independent judicial system. The DIFC Courts is the entity responsible for the independent administration and enforcement of justice in DIFC. The Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over all civil and commercial disputes arising within DIFC and or relating to bodies and companies registered in DIFC.
               </p>               
<p>                <strong>Financial Free Zone- </strong>  Developed as an “onshore” capital market, DIFC offers a perfect platform to access regional wealth and investment opportunities. It offers a wide network of double taxation treaties available to UAE incorporated entities. It has developed the same stature as New York, London and Hong Kong and primarily serves the vast region between Western Europe and East Asia.
