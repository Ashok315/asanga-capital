            <h3>Investment Advisory</h3>   
            <p class="text-left">
                The starting point is to know our clients well. Based on your unique set personal and financial goals, risk- return objectives and various constraints such as taxation, liquidity, time-horizon, legal etc., we develop an investment policy statement (IPS). IPS is used as the guiding tool to design the portfolio strategy, construction, asset allocation and risk management. We provide access to some of the best investment providers and services in the world and advise on the portfolio. The strategy and portfolio are actively monitored and reviewed for the performance and any deviation from the agreed investment policy.            </p>

            <h3>Integrated Wealth Planning</h3>   
            <p class="text-left">
                In addition to the breadth and depth of planning for your wealth, we can integrate every component and professional in your situation such as your lawyer, accountant, trustee, or realtor. Following open-architecture approach, we finally take it to the best execution through our tie-ups with globally leading Private Banks, Asset Managers, Brokers, Custodians, Insurers, Tax Consultants etc.. We work in a strong synergy with these service providers, complementing their services while remaining independent and representing our clients. We also work with top research providers, portfolio aggregation providers and other financial institutions to provide the most comprehensive, secure, independent, and timely advice to our clients.            </p>

            <h3>Credit & Corporate Advisory</h3>   
            <p class="text-left">
                We can help through your journey in the corporate lifecycle - identifying opportunities for business expansion; assisting with raising capital, identifying the right structures or vehicles, or liquidity solutions to allow you to focus on growth opportunities. We provide a range of services related to arranging and advising on credit. We negotiate a fine cost of loans based on our total relationship with the banks rather than a client relationship at an individual level. We advise and arrange for Lombard financing, loan against real estate, mortgage and project financing.

            <h3>Risk Management & Governance</h3>   
            <p class="text-left">
                Our clients' wealth, assets, and business interests are usually spread over multiple regions or jurisdictions. In addition, the risks to their business and personal wealth may change with time due to personal situations, legislation in the jurisdictions they operate in. We can help you to monitor such aspects to ring-fence your businesses, and de-risk them when required. Asanga can provide you with solutions for your diverse needs in the fields of insurance, family governance, wealth structuring and succession planning.
