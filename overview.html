         <img class="color_story mt-5 mb-3" src="./Images/color_story2.png" alt="about_logo" >

         <p>Selection of 3 colours over monochrome was to show our liking to the diversity and dynamism. The colours speak a lot and differently with people, here is what we felt from our 3 brand colours:</p>        
 
         <p class="p-green" >Green is one of the more restful colours, as it doesn’t force the eye to make any adjustments. It gives a sense of balance and calm as well as a connection to nature.

          Common associations for green include which we relate with: Nature, Health, Wealth, Tranquillity, Harmony</p>
         <p class="p-blue" >Like the calm seas, blue inspires a sense of calm and spiritual awareness along with feelings of trust. It offers a sense of confidence and professionalism.

          Common associations for blue include which we relate with: Wisdom, Loyalty, Spirituality, Sophistication, Respectability</p>
         <p class="p-gray" >Gray is one of the most neutral shades. The colour relates with timeless, practical, and unbiased feeling.

          Common associations for gray include which we relate with: Practicality, Efficiency, Timelessness, Classic, Serious
